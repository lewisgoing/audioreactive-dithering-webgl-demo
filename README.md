# Three.js Bayer Dither Playground

A tiny demo that combines [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) and [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) to render an animated Bayer-dither shader in the background.  
Four pages are prerendered from one template, each with its own mask geometry, pixel tint, and background colour.
